Python Image library for GASMIX EUDP Distro (PImGED) is used for handling image data collected 
during the experiments of the GASMIX project supported by EUDP, MAN ES and DTU. 

The framework is designed to handle large amounts of image data with limited computational 
resources. Several optimized function utilizing OpenCV C++, numba compilation and multithreading 
through the Joblib package, are used to speed-up computations and memory handling.

GASMIX experiments consist of inverse seeded jet flows, where the environment is seeded and use 
a jet of clean air for negative image. From the negative image a concentration is estimated 
Â½based on initial images before seeding and fully seeded.

## For more explicit information about the code, see the code pages [found here](https://benhartz.github.io/pimged-pages/)

## Installation
A test package is created for the project, and it is possible to install it, with dependencies 
from testPyPi using the following command in the terminal for a Windows machine:
```
python -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple PImGed
```

## Example scripts and data

### Get example scripts
Get the example scripts from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/benhartz/pimged-example), it is cloned by using the following command
```commandline
git clone https://github.com/benhartz/pimged-example.git
```

## Download the example data from this [figshare link](https://figshare.com/s/286bc4cf871abd25b1d1)


**-- OBS -- -- OBS --  -- OBS --** 

The data folder is ~6 GB of data, as it consist of  uncompressed tiff files directly from the 
high-speed camera sensor used.


---
### Folder setup
In the example folder is located an example script on using the PImGED package and its modules. 
The data folder contain 10 datasets obtained in the GASMIX test setup along with 10 pressure 
measurments in a ziped folder for speed-up of downloading instead of many small image files.

Unzip the data folder so the folder path looks as seen here, and the `working directory`
should be set inside the example folder, with the scripts.

### Example results
#### pimged_example.py
Now it should be possible to run the `pimged_example.py` script for testing simple data 
manangement and get these plots out. AVO translate to "After Valve Opening" and there is a delay 
due to the air has to travel through the jet, valve opening delay and delay in the relays 
sending the opening signal.

#### pimged_big_data_example.py
The `pimged_big_data_example.py` script show how to use the code for handling larger amounts of 
data to get concentrations fields.  Running `pimged_big_data_example.py` stores ~8.7 GB of data 
on the hard drive

The big data example should produce this plot

#### pimged_pod_example.py
To use the POD calculation module, run `pimged_pod_example.py` for an example on use. This 
example script takes some time to run, as it is an extensive algorithm. Running 
`pimged_pod_example.py` stores ~5.5 GB of data on the hard drive

The following plot should be produced

## Code structure
![codestructure](https://i.ibb.co/VDNfd9X/code-structure.png)


To handle larger data amounts the code takes inspiration from Panda on datastructure and 
implement a dataset module used for loading/saving data. The data is handled by datacontainers 
with functions for manipulating the individual datatypes. With the datacontainer module implementing
versatile classes for image and pressure datahandling, with common internal functions, it is 
possible to reduce code repetition and adding datacontainers to the module. The metadata from 
data is handled and stored for the individual dataset in the same datacontainer for and sent around 
with the data. The dataset module object is then used as an input for other modules that can use 
the standardrised data setup.
 
Handling standard calculations a calculation module takes the dataset object as an input. 
When new information is calculated it can then populate the dataset object with information, 
utilizing the indirection implementation of list and numpy arrays in python. This streamline the 
collection of data in one object that can load or save the data with minimal coding.

Between the whole framework, several functions are reused with simple coding and these are 
included in a utility package with the framework. Here is sorting of list elements widely used 
in folder and filenames, checking folder paths, handling metadata etc. 

Splitting the code framework into specialized modules decouple functionality and makes it 
easy to update individual functionality in different modules, without breaking code coherence.
